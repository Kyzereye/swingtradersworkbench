      <p className="rules-intro">
        These rules are for <strong>swing analysis on daily bars</strong>: each open
        and close is evaluated at the <strong>end-of-day close</strong>, not on
        intraday ticks. Orders are assumed to fill at the <strong>next
        session&apos;s open</strong> after the signal bar. Holds are meant to last
        multiple days or longer, not minutes or hours.
      </p>
      <p className="rules-intro">
        Signals are <strong>price vs moving average</strong> — where the daily
        close sits relative to the fast and slow MAs — not a fast/slow MA line
        crossover. Chart signals use the periods and open-confirm mode you set in
        the Chart sidebar. The nightly scan uses one close above fast (single
        confirm) with per-symbol MA periods from optimization — see below.
      </p>

      <section className="rules-section">
        <h2>Open</h2>
        <p>All of the following must be true on the daily close of the open bar:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Not already in a position</li>
          <li>Close is above the <strong>slow</strong> and <strong>fast</strong> moving average</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fast MA is above slow MA</strong> (uptrend alignment)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Open confirm</strong> (sidebar): either one close above fast,
            or <strong>two consecutive</strong> closes above fast (a dip back
            under fast resets the count)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section className="rules-section">
        <h2>Close</h2>
        <p>While in a position, on the daily close:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Close</strong> when price falls <strong>below the fast</strong>{" "}
            moving average
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <p className="rules-intro">
        After a close, a new open only happens when all open rules above are met
        again on a later bar.
      </p>

      <section className="rules-section">
        <h2>Still-open positions</h2>
        <p>
          If still in a position at the end of the loaded history, it is shown as
          still active in the opens &amp; closes table with no close date until a future bar
          triggers a close.
        </p>

      <section className="rules-section rules-section-muted">
        <h2>Moving average optimization</h2>
        <p>
          The nightly <strong>Signals</strong> scan and <strong>Daily log</strong>{" "}
          use a fast and slow MA pair chosen separately for each symbol from
          historical backtests. That optimization is a starting point only — it
          may not be optimal for every symbol or market conditions, and mistakes
          can occur.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the <strong>Chart</strong> tab, enter your own preferred fast and
          slow periods in the sidebar. Chart signals, markers, and the opens &amp; closes
          table use your settings, not the scan defaults.
